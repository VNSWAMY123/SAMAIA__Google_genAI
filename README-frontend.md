This is the **frontend branch** for the Google Gen (Global Youth Wellness) project.

## Purpose

This branch is dedicated to frontend development and contains:
- React.js applications and components
- TypeScript configurations and types
- Tailwind CSS styling and themes
- Frontend-specific build tools and configurations
- UI/UX components and design systems
- Client-side routing and state management

## Frontend Technologies

- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite/Create React App
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **State Management**: Context API / Redux (as needed)
- **Routing**: React Router

## Development Workflow

1. All frontend features should be developed in this branch
2. Create feature branches from `frontend` for new UI components
3. Test components thoroughly before merging
4. Ensure responsive design across all devices
5. Follow accessibility best practices

## Getting Started

1. Switch to frontend branch:
```bash
git checkout frontend
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Component Structure

Organize components following this structure:
- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/pages` - Page-level components
- `/src/hooks` - Custom React hooks
- `/src/utils` - Frontend utility functions
- `/src/styles` - Global styles and themes

## Contributing

When working on frontend features:
1. Create feature branches from `frontend`
2. Follow the existing code style and patterns
3. Write unit tests for components
4. Test across different browsers and devices
5. Submit pull requests back to `frontend` branch
